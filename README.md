React Class Project 

This repository contains a project called "2script" developed as part of the Advanced Client-Side Technologies class. 

The main objective of this project is to create a website using the React library to help and teach people, specifically students from my university and course, how to program in JavaScript. To achieve this goal, the following techniques and tools were implemented:

React as the main library for building the website.
JavaScript as the programming language.
User-friendly design and interface to enhance the user experience.
Educational content to assist in understanding JavaScript concepts.
Gamification techniques to make learning more enjoyable and interactive.

The website includes the following features:

A quiz system with questions about the presented content, divided into different difficulty levels, where users can earn points and climb the leaderboard.
An interactive glossary with key terms and concepts related to JavaScript and Algorithms.
Educational mini-games to reinforce the learned content and apply the acquired concepts.
Use of Blackly as a tool to support algorithmic concepts.
User data storage in a Firebase account, allowing tracking of their progress and performance. Additionally, a scoring system has been implemented, where users can view their performance and compare it with others through a scoreboard on the website.
Attractive design with a retro style to create a more engaging gaming experience, using Styled Components to style the pages.
User-friendly interface and appealing design to increase user motivation.
The website was developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React technologies. Its main purpose is to make learning JavaScript and Algorithms more enjoyable and interactive, ultimately increasing user motivation.
